Python implementation of [CellFIT](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0099116).
From [Wayne Brodland](http://www.civil.uwaterloo.ca/brodland/cellFIT.asp)'s web page:
CellFIT is a package of force inference equations and assessment tools that calculates the forces in cell edges based on their geometries. In this approach, cells in an image are segmented and equilibrium equations are constructed for each triple junction based solely on edge tensions and the angles at which edges approach each junction. Solving the resulting system of tension equations yields a set of relative edge tensions whose scaling must be determined from data external to the image.

In this implementation, the goal is to optimize the user interface for improved accessibility of CellFIT to scientists of all backgrounds across all platforms (Linux, MacOS, Windows). 
Applying this tool to the cell mechanics of wound healing is of particular interest.
